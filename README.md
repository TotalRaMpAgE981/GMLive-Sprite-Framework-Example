# GMLive-Sprite-Framework-Example
An example project using my sprite framework.

## Run Project
1. Go to [GMLive](https://yal.cc/r/gml/) and import the release package.
2. Press reload and it should display an old style RPG example layout with 3 slimes. 

If this does not work, find all instances of "_color" and replace with "_colour". There was an update that seemingly disabled US spelling of some functions.
